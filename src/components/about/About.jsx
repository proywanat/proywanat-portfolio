              Hello, my name is Wanat. I am currently working as a Software
              Developer with 1 year of experience. Recently, I have taken the
              opportunity to expand my knowledge beyond programming skills. I
              chose to study Data Engineering, focusing on Python, SQL, and data
              analysis tools such as Pandas and NumPy. Iâ€™ve also explored how to
              apply these skills to build Machine Learning models, alongside
              other areas like Big Data management and data visualization. After
              studying and working on projects, I found myself increasingly
              fascinated by the field of Data. This inspired me to delve deeper
              and seriously consider transitioning to a Data Engineer role in
              the future.
